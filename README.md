🎭 Drama Management Bureau – AI Roast-Therapy Web App
A Gen-Z Style Malayalam AI Counselling System
📌 Project Description

Drama Management Bureau is a fun, Gen-Z-themed AI counselling web application that gives users Malayalam roast-therapy + emotional support for their personal problems.
The system takes the user’s name, gender, and problem, sends it to a Node.js backend connected to Google Gemini, and generates a long, entertaining roast + motivational response.

The goal is to create a friendly, funny, engaging platform where users can vent their emotions and receive:
